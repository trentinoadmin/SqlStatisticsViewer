SQL Statistics Viewer
---
This is a simple .NET 8.0 Windows Forms application. The inspiration for this project was born from the need to quickly analyse the statistics output from the SQL Management Studio output window.

To use this application simply copy the statistics results from your SQL Management Studio output pane and paste into this application and click <strong>Parse</strong>. The Threshold number filters
out any 'Logical Reads' above the entered number. Change the number and press 'Enter' to re-parse the results.
